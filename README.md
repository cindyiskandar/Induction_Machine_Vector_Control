# Induction_Machine_Vector_Control
This Repository contains MATLAB files related to the vector control method for an induction machine.

"fct_trans.m" represents the MATLAB file for the vector control algorithm with the machine being represented by its transfer function and "Fct_app.slx" is its corresponding Simulink file.

"MAS_EVV_Init.m" represents the MATLAB file for the vector control algorithm with the machine being represented by its equations on Simulink (which is more realistic); "MAS_BF.slx", "MAS_180_BO.slx", "Rr_Variable.slx"; "PWM_inverter.slx", "gain_onduleur.slx" are the corresponding Simulink files.

Rapport MAS is the PDF report analysing the results of the Vecotr Control Method (in French).
